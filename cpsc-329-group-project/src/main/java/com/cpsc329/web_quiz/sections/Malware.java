When they opened the “love letter” it actually downloaded a visual basic script. It used a trick to hide that it was not a letter.

On May 24, 2020, Windows users started to receive emails with this malware attached. In just 10 days 50 million people reported being infected. It is estimated that 10% of the computers that are connected to the internet caught the ILOVEYOU malware. The economic effect of this was large. There were costs to remove the infection and then recover the files that backups. It is estimated this cost as much as 10 billion US dollars in the aftermath. After this incident, the UK parliament, the CIA and the pentagon closed their emails. The spread was so widespread because people downloaded stuff from their email without worry and did not listen to warnings about downloading things from the internet which allowed the malware to be so successful. It was one of the first big computer virus outbreaks and also showed that spam is a serious threat. It is not just annoying. It was a wakeup call for many regarding online safety. This is why education on online safety is critical to prevent disasters such as this. A simple fix of changing the default setting to showing the file extension could make users more aware of what they are opening."),

So, a DDoS will occur when there are more requests than the limit. This can cause the response to user’s requests to be slower or it can cause some user’s request to be ignored or all of them to be ignored. The aim is to make the website not function normally and the ultimate goal is to totally deny service to users.
